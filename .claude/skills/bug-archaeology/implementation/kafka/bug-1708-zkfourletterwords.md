**How to spot**
When reviewing core/src code, look for logic error in condition patterns. Check that all code paths handle edge cases and that the logic matches the documented contract. In particular: kafka-18443 remove zkfourletterwords (#18429).

**Test**
Test modified in ZkFourLetterWords.scala covering the corrected behaviour.
