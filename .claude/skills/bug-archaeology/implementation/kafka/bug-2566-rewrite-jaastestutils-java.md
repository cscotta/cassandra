**How to spot**
When reviewing checkstyle/suppressions.xml code, look for logic error in condition patterns. Check that all code paths handle edge cases and that the logic matches the documented contract. In particular: kafka-16682 rewrite jaastestutils by java (#16579).

**Test**
Test modified in JaasModule.java covering the corrected behaviour.
